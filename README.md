# FridaApp

Sample app and scripts used to hack it using [Frida](https://frida.re/docs/android/). I wanted to play with this tool after some conference, and I didnâ€™t find a nice all-in-one guide, so [I wrote one](https://medium.com/android-news/hacking-android-app-with-frida-a85516f4f8b7) and used this project for it.
